  <h1>One of the coolest survival games out there, Rust.</h1>
  <p>Rust is a relatively hardcore survival game, where you find yourself on the shore of an island completely naked. You find a rock, and you start to survive. There are lots of things in this world that wants you dead. Most of them are other players, because loot is not the easiest to find. But if they can kill you, they can take a lot of loot for free.</p>
  <h2>There's a lot of neat things in Rust, some of my favorites are:</h2>
