  <h1>Presents!</h1>
  <p>Every winter the makers of Rust bring in these presents that fall every night. the amount of presents that spawn around you are based off of the number of people on and also around you. There is always 2 per person, but it's quite funny to be sitting quietly in your base, hear the present sound, open your door, to see 10 or so of these guys sitting in the field right infront of you. It quickly turns into a death pit.</p>
